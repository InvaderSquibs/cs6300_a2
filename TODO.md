## Validation Testing Protocol

### For Each Tool (Tool 1, 2, 3, 4):
1. **Help Documentation Test**
   ```bash
   python3.11 src/chef_agent.py help
   # Verify tool appears in AVAILABLE TOOLS section
   ```

2. **Individual Tool Test**
   ```bash
   python3.11 src/chef_agent.py search "test query"
   # Verify JSON output format and data quality
   # Note: Agent may format JSON as human-readable text
   ```

3. **Error Handling Test**
   ```bash
   python3.11 src/chef_agent.py search ""
   python3.11 src/chef_agent.py search "invalid_query_12345"
   # Verify graceful error handling
   ```

### For Chaining Validation (Tool 2+):
4. **Pipeline Test**
   ```bash
   # Test Tool 1 → Tool 2
   python3.11 src/chef_agent.py search "vegan pancakes"
   # Then test extraction with returned URL
   
   # Test Tool 1 → Tool 2 → Tool 3
   # Then test scaling with extracted recipe
   
   # Test Tool 1 → Tool 2 → Tool 3 → Tool 4
   # Then test validation with scaled recipe
   ```

5. **Integration Test**
   ```bash
   python3.11 tests/run_tests.py
   # Run all automated tests
   ```

### Phase 6: Documentation & Evaluation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- [x] Implement evaluation metrics and test cases for each tool
- [x] Document tool specifications (inputs, outputs, error handling)
- [x] Create example scripts demonstrating agent capabilities
- [x] **FINAL VALIDATION**: Complete system test with all tools and help system

## Success Criteria
- **Tool 1**: ≥3 recipes found and extracted per search
- **Tool 2**: Accurate scaling + proper unit conversion
- **Tool 3**: Complete, well-formatted recipe with clear sections
- **Integration**: Robust error handling with graceful fallbacks

## Error Handling Strategy
- **Tool 1**: If no results → fail gracefully, suggest retry
- **Tool 2**: If scaling fails → try next recipe from Tool 1's list
- **Tool 3**: If validation fails → surface specific issues, try next recipe

## Development Approach
- Red-Green-Refactor methodology
- Test each tool thoroughly before moving to next
- Incremental validation at each step
- Focus on modularity and extensibility

## Development Notes & Decisions

### Phase 1-2 Completed (Recipe Search Tool)
**Key Decisions Made:**
1. **Single Agent Architecture**: All tools will be part of the same `chef_agent.py` rather than separate agents
2. **Dietary Restrictions Integration**: Added `dietary_restrictions` parameter to recipe search tool
3. **Query Enhancement**: Auto-append "recipe" to search queries for better DuckDuckGo results
4. **Smart Validation**: Reject empty, too short, or nonsensical queries before searching
5. **Contract-Based Output**: Established `RECIPE_FOUND:` and `NO_RECIPES_FOUND:` format for validation
6. **Error Handling**: Fixed empty string error handling to be deterministic

**Technical Implementation:**
- Used `smolagents` framework with `CodeAgent` and `Tool` classes
- Integrated `duckduckgo-search` for real recipe discovery
- Added `nullable: True` for optional parameters in tool definitions
- Enhanced agent prompts to handle JSON parsing and error responses
- Created comprehensive validation protocol with fast and full modes

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ All 5 validation tests pass (Help, Individual Tool, Dietary Restrictions, Error Handling, Automated Tests)
- ✅ Real recipe results from AllRecipes, Food Network, Bon Appétit
- ✅ Dietary restrictions working: "pancakes" + ["vegan"] → "vegan pancakes recipe"
- ✅ Error handling robust: Empty queries return proper error messages

### Phase 2.5 Completed (Recipe Extraction Tool - LLM-First Approach)
**Architecture Decision:**
1. **LLM-First Approach**: Replaced complex deterministic parsing with LLM natural language understanding
2. **Code Simplification**: Reduced from 400+ lines to ~150 lines of clean, maintainable code
3. **Superior Performance**: LLM handles any HTML structure without hardcoded patterns
4. **State Management**: Recipe objects include source URL, name, description, ingredients, steps, timing, dietary tags
5. **Tool Integration**: Recipe extraction tool added to the same agent as tool 2

**Implementation Results:**
- ✅ **LLM Natural Language Extraction**: Uses `qwen/qwen3-4b-2507` model for recipe understanding
- ✅ **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any website structure without pattern updates
- ✅ **Rich Data Extraction**: Gets ingredients, instructions, timing, servings, dietary tags automatically
- ✅ **Extraction Method**: `"llm_natural_language"` vs. complex deterministic parsing
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with informative error messages
- ✅ **Performance**: First-try success on challenging URLs that failed with deterministic approach

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ **Wholesome Yum**: 8 ingredients, 4 complete instructions, 30 min total time, keto-friendly
- ✅ **Challenging URLs**: Successfully extracts from complex sites that failed with deterministic parsing
- ✅ **Data Quality**: Perfect extraction with proper amounts, units, and cooking steps
- ✅ **Agent Integration**: Tool properly integrated with chef_agent.py and validation protocol
- ✅ **End-to-End Pipeline**: Complete validation with natural language requests working perfectly

### Phase 3 Completed (Recipe Scaling Tool - LLM-First Approach)
**Architecture Decision:**
1. **LLM-First Scaling**: Replaced deterministic conversion tables with LLM natural language understanding
2. **Natural Language Serving Detection**: LLM interprets prompts like "dinner party with 8 guests" → 8 servings
3. **Intelligent Unit Conversion**: LLM decides when to convert units based on context and readability
4. **Flexible Amount Formatting**: LLM chooses optimal format (fractions vs decimals) for readability
5. **Context-Aware Scaling**: LLM understands cooking context and scales appropriately

**Implementation Results:**
- ✅ **LLM Natural Language Scaling**: Uses `qwen/qwen3-4b-2507` model for serving size detection and scaling
- ✅ **Universal Serving Detection**: Handles any natural language prompt for serving size determination
- ✅ **Intelligent Unit Conversion**: LLM decides when to convert units (e.g., 16 cups → 1 gallon)
- ✅ **Natural Instruction Updates**: LLM rewrites instruction text with scaled amounts naturally
- ✅ **Scaling Metadata**: Provides detailed scaling information including detection method and conversions
- ✅ **Performance**: Dramatically simplified code while improving flexibility and accuracy

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ **Dinner Party Test**: "dinner party with 8 guests" → correctly detected 8 servings, scaled appropriately
- ✅ **Large Family Test**: "large family gathering" → scaled from 6-8 to 20 servings with 2.5x factor
- ✅ **Unit Conversion**: LLM intelligently converts units when amounts become unwieldy
- ✅ **Instruction Updates**: LLM naturally updates instruction text with new scaled amounts
- ✅ **Agent Integration**: Tool properly integrated with chef_agent.py and validation protocol

## 🔧 **CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX**

### **Issue 1: Scaling Tool Validation & Logging**
**Problem**: Scaling tool is being called but failing due to syntax errors, making it hard to validate it's actually working.

**Plan**:
1. **Fix Syntax Errors**: 
   - Fix the double comma issue in scaling prompts
   - Ensure proper JSON formatting in agent prompts
   - Test with simple scaling requests first

2. **Add Better Validation Logging**:
   - Log when scaling tool is actually called vs. just detected
   - Show the exact scaling math (original → target → factor)
   - Validate that scaled recipe has different serving count
   - Log the tool execution in agent logs

3. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Catch and display scaling errors more clearly
   - Fallback gracefully when scaling fails
   - Show what went wrong in scaling attempts

4. **Test Validation**:
   - Test with known scaling scenarios (6→24, 4→12, etc.)
   - Verify the markdown output shows scaled servings
   - Confirm ingredient amounts are actually scaled

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Results**:
- ✅ **Fixed Syntax Errors**: Removed problematic `target_servings='auto'` parameter
- ✅ **Added Comprehensive Logging**: Shows scaling detection, tool calls, and math
- ✅ **Validated Scaling Tool Execution**: Confirmed tool is actually called vs. just detected
- ✅ **Proved Mathematical Scaling**: Shows 12 → 24 (factor: 2.0) with ingredient adjustments
- ✅ **Markdown Shows Scaled Servings**: Final file correctly shows "24 Servings"
- ✅ **Complete Pipeline Working**: Search → Extract → Scale → Format all working
