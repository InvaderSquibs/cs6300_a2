- **üìÑ Recipe Extraction**: Extract detailed recipe information from any website using LLM natural language understanding
- **‚öñÔ∏è Recipe Scaling**: Intelligently scale recipes for different serving sizes with unit conversions
- **üìù Recipe Formatting**: Generate beautiful markdown recipe files in cookbook style

   ```

## Usage

### Natural Language Requests (Recommended)

```bash
# Basic recipe request
python3.11 src/chef_agent.py "I'd like some pancakes please"

# With dietary restrictions
python3.11 src/chef_agent.py "I'd like some pancakes please" --restrictions vegan,gluten-free

# With scaling for specific serving size
python3.11 src/chef_agent.py "I'd like some vegan pancakes for a family gathering with 12 people" --restrictions vegan
```

### Legacy Commands

```bash
# Show help and available tools
python3.11 src/chef_agent.py help

# Search for recipes
python3.11 src/chef_agent.py search "pancakes"
python3.11 src/chef_agent.py search "pancakes" --diet "vegan,gluten-free"

# Extract recipe from URL
python3.11 src/chef_agent.py extract "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/191885/vegan-pancakes/"

# Run end-to-end tests
python3.11 src/chef_agent.py e2e
python3.11 src/chef_agent.py e2e --diet "vegan"

# Interactive mode
python3.11 src/chef_agent.py
```

## Output

The AI Chef Assistant generates beautiful markdown recipe files in the `results/` directory. Each recipe includes:

- **Professional formatting** with clear sections and headers
- **Complete ingredient lists** with proper measurements
- **Step-by-step instructions** with cooking tips
- **Timing information** (prep time, cook time, total time)
- **Dietary information** and source attribution
- **Enhanced descriptions** and helpful cooking notes

### Example Output File

Recipes are saved as markdown files in the `results/` directory, for example:
- `results/vegan_pancakes.md`
- `results/chocolate_chip_cookies.md`
- `results/gluten_free_bread.md`

## Supported Dietary Restrictions

- vegan, vegetarian
- keto, paleo
- gluten-free, dairy-free
- nut-free, soy-free
- sugar-free, low-carb, high-protein

## Architecture

The AI Chef Assistant uses a **LLM-first approach** with 4 specialized tools:

1. **RecipeSearchTool**: Searches for recipes with dietary filtering
2. **RecipeExtractionLLMTool**: Extracts recipe data using LLM natural language understanding
3. **RecipeScalingLLMTool**: Scales recipes intelligently with unit conversions
4. **RecipeFormatterLLMTool**: Formats recipes into beautiful markdown files

## Testing

Run the validation protocol to test all functionality:

```bash
# Fast mode (basic test)
python3.11 tests/validation_protocol.py --fast

# Full validation suite
python3.11 tests/validation_protocol.py
```

## Development

The project follows a modular architecture with separate tool files:

- `src/chef_agent.py` - Main agent orchestrator
- `src/tools/recipe_search.py` - Recipe search functionality
- `src/tools/recipe_extraction_llm.py` - LLM-powered recipe extraction
- `src/tools/recipe_scaling_llm.py` - LLM-powered recipe scaling
- `src/tools/recipe_formatter_llm.py` - LLM-powered recipe formatting
- `tests/validation_protocol.py` - Comprehensive test suite
